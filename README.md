# Arc-Riccardinho Elementary Os Themes

In Arc-Riccardinho.zip there are two themes, based on the well known Arc-themes. 
With these two themes, one white and one darker, I solved some problems that happened when I tried to fit these themes in my Elementary 0.4 Os.

How we can see here, the difference is little but relevant:
This is the standard Arc-Darker Theme:

This is the Arc-Darker-Riccardinho Theme:
![Arc-Darker-Riccardinho](https://github.com/Riccardinhocala/arc-riccardinho/blob/master/Arc-Darker-Riccardinho.png)

# Install

```sh
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/Riccardinhocala/arc-riccardinho
cd ~
cd arc-riccardinho
unzip Arc-Riccardinho.zip 
sudo cp -r Arc-Darker-Riccardinho/ /usr/share/themes/
sudo cp -r Arc-Riccardinho/ /usr/share/themes/
```

Now use Tweak tools to change your theme.

Enjoy!
